area:
- highlight camera / route point when relevant. (ALSO APPLIES TO MKDD)
- deal/check with area type 3 routes
- deal with area connections in general
- type four: refactor enemypoint so that it stores the actual enemy point itself. then in data_editor, use the index.

- add 'c' linking for areas 

came:
- camera replaying (long shot)
- properly hide fields
