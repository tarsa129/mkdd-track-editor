mkwii to do list:

ktpt
- move header stuff to ktpt / ktpts at load, only move back at save
- display the range using render_cube

enemy/item/checkpoint
- handle automatic routing for prev/next groups when edited manually
- add a "remove empty groups" button, and empty groups should be deleted upon all the points being removed
- enemy/item: get the scale rendering correct 
- enemy/item multiselect: increase/decrease scale
- checkpoint: add "assign to closest respawn" button
- checkpoint: refactor respawn_id so that it stores the actual respawn itself. then in data_editor, use the id
- pointgroups: add helper function for getting the absolute index of a point 

gobj:
- all those dang .json files
- proper hiding of routes field
- add "remove all of type" option as a treeview custom object
- add "add pocha" object

poti:
- check autorouting for cameras / Objects
-- just make an array for camera types that connect to a route in data_editor_options and use that everywhere
- show splines
- v options
-- route: add to end of groups
-- point: add point here

area:
- highlight camera / route point when relevant. (ALSO APPLIES TO MKDD)
- deal/check with area type 3 routes
- deal with area connections in general
- type four: refactor enemypoint so that it stores the actual enemy point itself. then in data_editor, use the index. 
-- ONLY have to worry about deletions, as additions will preserve the existence of the point
- add helper functions in areas to get all areas of a specific type
- add 'c' linking for areas 

came:
- camera replaying (long shot)
- properly hide fields

jugem:
- add a "grab closest button for existing jugem"
- add a "add and grab closest" button
