mkwii to do list:

enemy/item/checkpoint
- pointgroups: add helper function for getting the absolute index of a point 
- when a group is selected from the treeview, the arrows are not being highlighted
- checkpoint: add special stuff for lap counters
- checkpoint: make constant values for highlighted, etc

gobj:
- all those dang .json files
-- proper hiding of routes field

poti:
- check autorouting for cameras / Objects
-- just make an array for camera types that connect to a route in data_editor_options and use that everywhere
- show splines
- show route when highlighted from treeview

area:
- highlight camera / route point when relevant. (ALSO APPLIES TO MKDD)
- deal/check with area type 3 routes
- deal with area connections in general
- type four: refactor enemypoint so that it stores the actual enemy point itself. then in data_editor, use the index. 
-- ONLY have to worry about deletions, as additions will preserve the existence of the point
- add helper functions in areas to get all areas of a specific type
- add 'c' linking for areas 

came:
- camera replaying (long shot)
- properly hide fields

mspt:
 - deal with mspt ids (how are they used?)
