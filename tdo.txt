mkwii to do list:

- add arrows for directions of links in enemy/item/checkpoints

fix local bugs found (make sure that current qol works and is relevant to mkwii)
compare scale to lorenzis for enemy points
deal with juge / mspt ids
render key checkpoints

general optimizations:
more options for multi select like
-enemy routes: mass edit scale
camera replaying???
properly hide fields for cameras
when selecting areas, the camera and route should also be highlighted


mkwii optimizations

checkpoints: link groups together in render
object: all those .json files
routes: show splines
area: highlight camera / route point when relevant. deal with area routes
objects: do not show route if there is none

before release: match lorenzis with colors
error analyzer
