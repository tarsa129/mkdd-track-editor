mkwii to do list:

ktpt
- move header stuff to ktpts at load, only move back at save (current on ktpt)
- display the range using render_cube

enemy/item/checkpoint
- handle automatic routing for prev/next groups when edited manually
- enemy/item: get the scale rendering correct 
- enemy/item multiselect: increase/decrease scale
- pointgroups: add helper function for getting the absolute index of a point 
- when a group is selected from the treeview, the arrows are not being highlighted

gobj:
- all those dang .json files
- proper hiding of routes field
- add "remove all of type" option as a treeview context menu
- add "add pocha" object

poti:
- check autorouting for cameras / Objects
-- just make an array for camera types that connect to a route in data_editor_options and use that everywhere
- show splines
- v options
-- route: add to end of groups
-- point: add point here

area:
- highlight camera / route point when relevant. (ALSO APPLIES TO MKDD)
- deal/check with area type 3 routes
- deal with area connections in general
- type four: refactor enemypoint so that it stores the actual enemy point itself. then in data_editor, use the index. 
-- ONLY have to worry about deletions, as additions will preserve the existence of the point
- add helper functions in areas to get all areas of a specific type
- add 'c' linking for areas 

came:
- camera replaying (long shot)
- properly hide fields

mspt:
 - deal with mspt ids (how are they used?)

before release: match lorenzis with colors

general:
error analyzer - i'll figure this out when i get to it
starting mode topdown vs 3d - add to config file
refactor options code to move stuff to libkmp
add limit checks of 255 on everything
add an option for "cleanup"
- merge enemy groups, and removed unused groups
- remove unused respawns
- remove unused paths
- remove unused cameras
popup for "fixes made on load"
