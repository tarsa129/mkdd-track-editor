mkwii to do list:

enemy/item/checkpoint
- add arrows for directions of links between groups
- handle automatic routing for prev/next groups when edited manually
- make "v" a more universal "add stuff" option
-- if selecting point, 'v' should add points at current position
-- if selecting a group, 'v' should add points at the end of the group
-- if selecting a groups, 'v' should add empty groups
- add a "remove empty groups" button, and empty groups should be deleted upon all the points being removed

fix local bugs found (make sure that current qol works and is relevant to mkwii)
compare scale to lorenzis for enemy points
deal with juge / mspt ids
render key checkpoints

general optimizations:
more options for multi select like
-enemy routes: mass edit scale
camera replaying???
properly hide fields for cameras
when selecting areas, the camera and route should also be highlighted


mkwii optimizations

object: all those .json files
routes: show splines
area: highlight camera / route point when relevant. deal with area type 3 routes
objects: do not show route in dataeditor if there is none
jugem: add a "grab closest button for existing jugem" and an "add and grab closest" button
before release: match lorenzis with colors
error analyzer
