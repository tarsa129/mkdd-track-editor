mkdd-master to do list:
drag n drop opening

mkwii to do list:

ktpt
- add 'v' option for addition

enemy/item/checkpoint
- pointgroups: add helper function for getting the absolute index of a point (for area) and enemy point from an absolute index
- checkpoints: fix concave checkpoints
- checkpoints: better handling of split route key cps

gobj:
- manually improve all descriptions / settings / and add default values
- line drawing for item boxes via "i"

poti:
- show splines (talk to zatchi)
- camera auto route - make it based on the total length (parse all files to find average distance / speed)

area:
- highlight camera / route point when relevant. (ALSO APPLIES TO MKDD)
-- bold and have circles for cams and their routes (for consistency)
- deal/check with area type 3 routes
-- bold and have circles around each point
- type four: refactor enemypoint so that it stores the actual enemy point itself. then in data_editor, use the index.
-- ONLY have to worry about deletions, as additions will preserve the existence of the point
-- do the same for cameras and routes
- add 'c' linking for areas
- render area connections in a consistent color
- improve side button options for individual areas
-- remove the "all areas" side button optiosn for individual areas
-- when an area with a connection is highlighted, have special functions (like assign)

came:
- camera replaying (long shot)
- if a camera/area is invalid, it does not matter what the actual type is, so remove its display in the treeview

before release: match lorenzis with colors

general:
error analyzer - i'll figure this out when i get to it
add "stuff fixed at lauch" based on errors found during fix_file
refactor options code to move stuff to libkmp
do not ground on invisible triangles (mkdd as well)
