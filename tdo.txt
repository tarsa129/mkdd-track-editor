mkdd-master to do list:
drag n drop opening

mkwii to do list:

enemy/item/checkpoint
- pointgroups: add helper function for getting the absolute index of a point (for area) and enemy point from an absolute index
- checkpoint: add special stuff for lap counters
- checkpoint: make constant values for highlighted, etc

gobj:
- manually improve all descriptions / settings / and add default values

poti:
- show splines (talk to zatchi)
- camera options: auto do the frames field (based on the length to the next point)
-- on creation, auto do it (based on first connection)
-- have an option to fill it out automatically

area:
- highlight camera / route point when relevant. (ALSO APPLIES TO MKDD)
- deal/check with area type 3 routes
- deal with area connections in general
- type four: refactor enemypoint so that it stores the actual enemy point itself. then in data_editor, use the index. 
-- ONLY have to worry about deletions, as additions will preserve the existence of the point
- add helper functions in areas to get all areas of a specific type
- add 'c' linking for areas 

came:
- camera replaying (long shot)
- properly hide fields

juge:
- when adding respawn points, use the angle of the closest two enemypoints
- edit treeview to remove the parenthesis

before release: match lorenzis with colors

general:
error analyzer - i'll figure this out when i get to it
starting mode topdown vs 3d - add to config file
refactor options code to move stuff to libkmp
add limit checks of 255 on everything
add an option for "cleanup"
- merge enemy groups, and removed unused groups
- remove unused respawns
- remove unused paths
- remove unused cameras
have two load options: normal load and load with cleanup
