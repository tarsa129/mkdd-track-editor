mkwii to do list:

ktpt
- move header stuff to ktpt / ktpts at load, only move back at save
- display the range using render_cube

enemy/item/checkpoint
- add arrows for directions of links between groups
- handle automatic routing for prev/next groups when edited manually
- make "v" a more universal "add stuff" option
-- if selecting point, 'v' should add points at current position
-- if selecting a group, 'v' should add points at the end of the group
-- if selecting a groups, 'v' should add empty groups
- add a "remove empty groups" button, and empty groups should be deleted upon all the points being removed
- refactor more_buttons and button_add_from_addi_option to clean up the buttons
- enemy/item: get the scale rendering correct 
- enemy/item multiselect: increase/decrease scale
- checkpoint: add "assign to closest respawn" button
- checkpoint: refactor respawn_id so that it stores the actual respawn itself. then in data_editor, use the id
- pointgroups: add helper function for getting the absolute index of a point 

gobj:
- all those dang .json files
- proper hiding of routes field
- add "remove all of type" option as a treeview custom object
- add "add pocha" object

poti:
- check autorouting for cameras / Objects
-- just make an array for camera types that connect to a route in data_editor_options and use that everywhere
- show splines
- v options
-- route: add to end of groups
-- point: add point here

area:
- highlight camera / route point when relevant. (ALSO APPLIES TO MKDD)
- deal/check with area type 3 routes
- deal with area connections in general
- type four: refactor enemypoint so that it stores the actual enemy point itself. then in data_editor, use the index. 
-- ONLY have to worry about deletions, as additions will preserve the existence of the point
- add helper functions in areas to get all areas of a specific type

came:
- camera replaying (long shot)
- properly hide fields

jugem:
- add a "grab closest button for existing jugem"
- add a "add and grab closest" button

mspt:
 - deal with mspt ids (how are they used?)

before release: match lorenzis with colors

general:
error analyzer - i'll figure this out when i get to it
starting mode topdown vs 3d - add to config file
refactor options code to move stuff to libkmp
