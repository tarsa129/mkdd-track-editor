mkwii to do list:

ktpt
- add 'v' option for addition

enemy/item/checkpoint
- pointgroups: add helper function for getting the absolute index of a point (for area) and enemy point from an absolute index

gobj:
- manually improve all descriptions / settings / and add default values
- line drawing for item boxes

poti:
- show splines (talk to zatchi)
- camera auto route - make it based on the total length (parse all files to find average distance / speed)

area:
- highlight camera / route point when relevant. (ALSO APPLIES TO MKDD)
- deal/check with area type 3 routes
- deal with area connections in general
- type four: refactor enemypoint so that it stores the actual enemy point itself. then in data_editor, use the index. 
-- ONLY have to worry about deletions, as additions will preserve the existence of the point
- add helper functions in areas to get all areas of a specific type
- add 'c' linking for areas 
- render area connections in a consistent color

came:
- camera replaying (long shot)

before release: match lorenzis with colors

general:
error analyzer - i'll figure this out when i get to it
refactor options code to move stuff to libkmp
add an option for "cleanup"
- parse areas, remove areas with invalid connections
generation
- create checkpoints from enemyroutes
- copy enemypoints to itempoints
- create respawns from checkpoints
- add opening cams
