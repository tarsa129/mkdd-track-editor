# gcn kmp editor (demake)
a port of the mkdd track editor (.bol files) to mkwii's .kmp files. currently, a work in progress, but on here in case anyone wants to help, monitor progress, or point out bugs. all files will be saved to a backup file, for safety

## running from source
this editor uses python, which will need to be installed. in addition, a few libraries are needed
* PyQt5
* PyOpenGL
* numpy
* scipy

These can be installed via pip. 
Then, the kmp_editor.py file can be ran.
