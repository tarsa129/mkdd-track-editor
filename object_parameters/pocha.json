    "Description": "Generates a water splash effect when a player touches [[KCL flag#Fall Boundary (0x10)|KCL flag 0x10]] with variants 1 (water) or 3 (icy water that also needs the {{obj-ref|0x17|ice}} object). Also works for [[KCL flag#Effect Trigger (0x1A)|KCL flag 0x1A]] with variant 2, but cannot be triggered again until the player respawns. Only the Y coordinate is used."
